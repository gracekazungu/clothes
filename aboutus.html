    <h1>MY VISION</h1>
    <p>I aim to be at the forefront of the circular economy model <br> by enabling the re-use of second-hand clothes. <br> In doing so, we lower carbon emissions and assist in the fight against climate change. <br> The re-use of clothes also helps to mitigate other environmental <br> concerns by reducing excessive consumption of brand new clothes that cause an additional strain on resources.</p>
